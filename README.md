# University-Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on during my master's degree in Data Analytics for Business. The projects were part of the following courses, listed in chronological order:

1. **Applied Linear Models (R)**: this project involves fitting a linear regression model in order to explain which elements of a ski resort influence the price of the ski pass. It also included operations like subset selection, diagnostics and tests on the coefficients.

3. **Bayesian Modelling (R)**: this project applies Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) using both logit and probit regression models to predict whether asteroids are hazardous for Earth, based on various orbital and physical features. After Bayesian inference and posterior analysis, both models are evaluated on a test set using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, and confusion matrices. Both models achieved high performance, suggesting robust predictive power under Bayesian modelling.

5. **Text Mining (Python)**:

7. **Deep Learning (Python)**: this project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch (PyTorch) to classify weather conditions from images into 11 categories (e.g., Rain, Snow, Fog). The model architecture is based on Inception v1 (GoogLeNet) with Batch Normalization. The network is trained and evaluated with techniques like early stopping and class weighting to address overfitting and class imbalance. The final model achieves high accuracy and shows potential for real-world applications.

9. **Statistical Learning (R)**: in this project we analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. After preprocessing and feature engineering, we tuned models using cross-validation and evaluated them on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model with the highest overall accuracy (85.4%) and strong balance between sensitivity and specificity, making it the most reliable for survival prediction.

For every project you can find the ipynb or Rmd files.
