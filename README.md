# University-Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on during my master's degree in Data Analytics for Business. The projects were part of the following courses, listed in chronological order:

1. **Applied Linear Models**: the first project I worked on, it consisted in fitting a linear regression model with the aim of explaining which elements of a ski resort influence the price of the ski pass. It also included operations like subset selection, diagnostics and tests on the coefficients.

3. **Bayesian Modelling**:

5. **Text Mining**:

7. **Deep Learning**:

9. **Statistical Learning**:

For every project you can find the pdf file and the Rmd / ipynb file.
